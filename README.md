CREATING AN ONLINE RESTAURANT MENU USING REACT

This idea behind this app is to create a 'template' for restraunt / coffee shop / pub websites that showcase their menues. The data is not hard coded, but stored in a Firebase Database, and can be edited through an admin page with full CRUD. Admins have to log in to edit. Database costs should be $0.
